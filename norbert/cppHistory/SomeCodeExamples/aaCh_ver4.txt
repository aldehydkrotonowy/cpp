  In first, I suppose that your c and h files are in the directory :

   C:\Mes Documents\c\ch\bernard

  In the dosshell of Ch type :

  cd C:\Mes Documents\c\ch\bernard  RETURN


  Now if you want to try the file "addmFR.c" type :

  addmFR.c RETURN


  Or if you want to choose the size of the matrices type : 

  addmFR.c 2 3 RETURN


  To quit Ch type :

  exit RETURN 
  exit RETURN 

 Ps : "cd" dos command for change directory.
