
              Reference Mathematic books :
              ==========================

 I give these books for help. 
 The student solutions manuals, are indispensable.
 These books are not the best, 
 (I don't know the best), 
 but just good books.

 I think it is best to begin by the first step,
 then the second step, ...

 In the second step you can begin, for example by :

    a)         the calulus book.
    b) or      the linear algebra book.
    c) or with the two books in the same time.

 
                     First Step :
                     ==========

 By Swokowski :

    a) Algebra and Trigonometry with Analytic Geometry.
    b) Student solutions manual.


                     Second Step :
                     ===========

 By Swokowski :

    a) Calculus.
    b) Student's solutions manual (vol1, vol2).


 By Anton-Rorres

    a) Elementary Linear Algebra (Applications version)
    b) Student's solutions manual.
